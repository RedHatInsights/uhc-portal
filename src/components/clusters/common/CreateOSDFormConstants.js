  clusterNameHint:
    'This name identifies your cluster in OpenShift Cluster Manager and forms part of the cluster console subdomain.',
  availabilityHintSingleZone:
    'Single zone clusters reside in a singular fault domain and lack the resilience of multi-zone clusters.',
  availabilityHintMultiZone:
    'Three availability zones provide resilience to cluster components evenly spread across fault domains.',
  regionHint: 'The data center where your compute pool will be located.',
  persistentStorageHint: 'The storage quota set on the deployed cluster.',
  loadBalancersHint: 'The load balancer quota set on the deployed cluster.',
  computeNodeInstanceTypeHint: `The instance type for the compute nodes. Instance type
    determines the amount of memory and vCPU allocated to each compute node.`,
  computeNodeCountHint:
    'The number of compute nodes to provision per zone. The minimum number of compute nodes will vary depending on which features are enabled.',
  hcpComputeNodeCountHintWizard:
    'The number of compute nodes to provision per machine pool. The minimum number of compute nodes will vary depending on which features are enabled and how many machine pools will be created.',
  hcpComputeNodeCountHint:
    'The number of compute nodes to provision. The minimum number of compute nodes will vary depending on which features are enabled and how many machine pools exist.',

  machineCIDRHint: `A block of IP addresses used by the OpenShift Container Platform installation
    program while installing the cluster. The address block must not overlap with any other network
    block.`,
  serviceCIDRHint: `A block of IP addresses for services. OpenShiftSDN allows only one
    serviceNetwork block. The address block must not overlap with any other network block.`,
  podCIDRHint: `A block of IP addresses from which Pod IP addresses are allocated. The OpenShiftSDN
    network plug-in supports multiple cluster networks. The address blocks for multiple cluster
    networks must not overlap.  Select address pools large enough to fit your anticipated workload.`,
  hostPrefixHint: `The subnet prefix length to assign to each individual node.  For example, if host
    prefix is set to /23, then each node is assigned a /23 subnet out of the given CIDR, allowing
    for 510 (2^(32 - 23) - 2) pod IP addresses.`,
  bypassSCPChecksHint: `Some AWS service control policies (SCP) will cause installation to fail even if
    the credentials have the correct permissions. Disabling SCP checks allows installation to proceed.
    The SCP will still be enforced even if the checks are bypassed.`,
  enableAdditionalEtcdHint:
    'When you enable etcd encryption, encryption keys are created. These keys are rotated on a weekly basis.',
  enableAdditionalEtcdHypershiftHint:
    'Etcd is always encrypted by ROSA keys. If you want to provide your own AWS KMS key to encrypt etcd, you may do that here.',
  autoscaleHint:
    'Autoscaling automatically adds and removes nodes from the cluster based on resource requirements.',
  keyRing:
    'A key ring organizes keys in a specific Google Cloud location and allows you to manage access control on groups of keys.',
  keyName:
    'A cryptographic key is a resource that is used for encrypting and decrypting data or for producing and verifying digital signatures',
  keylocation:
    'A key location represent the geographical regions where a Cloud KMS resource is stored and can be accessed.',
  kmsserviceAccount: 'Compute Engine default service account.',
  enableUserWorkloadMonitoringHint:
    'Monitor your own projects in isolation from Red Hat Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) platform metrics.',
  enableUserWorkloadMonitoringHelp: `This feature is enabled by default and provides monitoring for user-defined projects. 
 This includes metrics provided through service endpoints in user-defined projects as well as pods running in user-defined projects.`,
  cloudKMSTitle: 'Cloud Key Management Service',
  cloudKMS:
    'Cloud KMS is a REST API that can use a key to encrypt, decrypt, or sign data such as secrets for storage.',
  amazonEBSTitle: 'Amazon EBS encryption',
  amazonEBS:
    'Provide your own AWS KMS key ARN for encryption of EBS resources associated with your EC2 instances.',
  awsKeyARN:
    'The key ARN is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a CMK. It is a unique, fully qualified identifier for the CMK. A key ARN includes the AWS account, Region, and the key ID.',
  privateLinkHint:
    'To provide support, Red Hat Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) connects to the cluster using only AWS PrivateLink endpoints instead of public endpoints.  This option cannot be changed after a cluster is created.',
  clusterProxyHint:
    'Enable an HTTP or HTTPS proxy to deny direct access to the internet from your cluster.',
  privateServiceConnectHint:
    'To provide support, Red Hat Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) connects to the cluster using only GCP Private Service Connect endpoints instead of public endpoints. This option cannot be changed after a cluster is created.',
  enableSecureBootHint: `Secure Boot enables the use of Shielded VMs in the Google Cloud Platform. Shielded VMs help protect enterprise workloads from threats like remote attacks, privilege escalation, and malicious insiders. Secure Boot support requires OpenShift version ${MIN_SECURE_BOOT_VERSION} or above.`,
  domainPrefixHint:
    "A domain prefix will be used for the subdomain and limited to 15 characters. If you do not create a custom domain prefix, we'll generate one for you.",
