# :cookie: Release to Production

1. #### Pick the latest commit hash that can be released to Prod from master

   Look at commits and pick the last commit that has all pipelines passed. Click on the "copy full SHA" for the commit you chose, and save it for later use.

   Ensure all phases of the Staging deployment queue are passing:

    - [`master` branch build-job][31] <sup>[1][footnotes]</sup>
    - [Qontract-reconcile pipeline][33]
    - [OpenShift-SaaS deployment pipeline][34]

   Check that the [daily QE smoke-test runs][32] have passed.

1. #### Update [_deploy.yml_ in app-interface][17] to bump the Production deployment-target <sup>[2][footnotes]</sup>

   In your app-interface fork, create a new topic branch from `master`.  
   Under the section `# Production Deployment`, update `ref` to the new full-hash from step 1.

   Commit and push changes, and create an MR against the upstream repo' ([example MR][9])

   Note that this MR will get merged automatically <sup>[3][footnotes]</sup>, once approvers post a `/lgtm` comment.  Also note, that **you** are on the approvers list, which means you can self-approve.


1. #### Ensure the [deployment pipeline][22] completes successfully

   Or wait for a notification on [#ocm-ui-deploys][16].  It'd look like this:

   > **sass notifier**  
   > ðŸŸ¢ SaaS file uhc-portal deployment to environment insights-production: Success ([Open][19]). Reason: https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/commit/c69b541ba3e23e0e9787b7e780a937a9151212cf triggered by _openshift-saas-deploy-trigger-configs_

   For further verification, browse the [app.info.json file in Production][23], and ensure that `src_hash` matches the new merge-commit hash.


1. #### Create a GitHub-release & release notes

   From the [Releases page][35], click _Draft a new release_.

   For the title, enter the release date in full, human-readable form, e.g. _March 5, 2025_.

   In the tag dropdown, enter tag name as date in abbreviated form, e.g. _mar-5-2025_, and choose _Create new tag on publish_.  Under _Previous tag_, select the previous release's tag.

   Click _Generate release notes_, and then _Publish release_.

1. #### Announce the release on the [#ocm-osd-ui][13] public slack forum

   Use this message (just update the Release Notes link to the latest release, before posting):

   > Hey all,
   >
   > A new release of OCM UI is now available in [production][24].  
   > See the [Release Notes][35].
   >
   > â›µ

# :dart: Troubleshooting


### Deployment-pipeline is not running

The deployment-queue consists of two pipelines: [app-interface Qontract-reconcile][21] and [OpenShift-SaaS][22].

The [Qontract-reconcile][28] pipeline picks up changes to configs (templates) from app-interface, and introduces (applies) them to deployment clusters.  The OpenShift-SaaS pipeline then gets triggered in response, and does the actual publish to _console.redhat.com/openshift_.

Ensure the reconcile pipeline is working first, and if not, check that the MR to app-interface was merged properly.  If it was, try to revive the pipeline-run by triggering a new build in the `stable` build [job][14].

Otherwise, ping @emalka or someone from <abbr title="TODO - find the appropriate channel (is it #sd-appsre?)">#_____</abbr> for help.

# :pencil2: Footnotes


_<sup>1</sup> This job will build the app in a container, and push a container-image to [quay.io/uhc-portal][15], tagging it with the short-hash (first few chars) of the relevant commit from its branch._

_<sup>2</sup> Updating this hash will trigger the deployment-queue, which publishes the newly built container-image to the Production env'._

_<sup>3</sup> App-interface offers "self-service" in many areas; it will spawn a bot on self-serviceable MRs, which will resolve the required reviewers ("approvers"), and post that list in a comment.  Once the MR gets a LGTM from every group on the approvers list, it will get merged.
For more details on self-service, see [User Content Approval Process][25] and [Granular Permission Model][26] on app-interface docs._
