# Continuous integration

We use [Konflux][1] for CI, and own the 'ocm-ui-tenant' namespace which hosts the ['ocm-ui'][8] application.
            

## Build pipelines

The FE app is built onto container images, which are pushed into the quay.io registry; PR changes are built via the ['pull-request' pipeline][3] and long-lived branches (e.g. 'main') â€“ via the ['push' pipeline][4] (see ['pipeline runs' in Konflux UI][9]).  Both are stored in a quay repo under the [redhat-user-workloads][2] org'.

Konflux will take care to take [snapshots][5] and create [releases][6], which are stored under the [redhat-services-prod][7] quay org'.
        

## Persisted configuration

Most of our Konflux configuration (e.g. our Konflux app, component, integration-test scenario, release-admission plans, user access) is persisted as yaml files in the [konflux-release-data][10] repository, and then parsed and displayed by Konflux UI.  
See there for more info on how to generate or update these configs.


## Our custom setup

Our repo declares a non-default pipeline-run config, which extends a remote pipeline config commonly used in HCC tenant-apps.  This config is equipped with an additional custom task for running additional verification (e.g. unit-tests, linter) during build.

See [docker-build-run-unit-tests][11] at the _RedHatInsights/konflux-pipelines_ repo.
